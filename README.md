# BattlePy = BatallaNaval

BattlePy is a project made in python based on the popular table game "Battleship"

Sorry for using spanish in some parts of the project, I started it as a project that
was not supposed to be seen by anybody.

## Usage

Try running from your file manager:

- main.py

If you want to use it from a console:

- py main.py

- python main.py

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. This is not something really important, I just made it for fun.
I looked after this code I made two years ago, I rewrited everything to make it more modular,
and also less naive. I will try to make it interesting adding different functionalities.
